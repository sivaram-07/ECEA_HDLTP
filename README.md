# HDL-Training
## Week-1
      I've already have my laptop installed with Vivado 2020.3,iverilog and gtkwave as a part of my summer project.
      I did download the sample files of fulladder and created a project in Vivado.
      I've attached the screenshots of rtl_schematic and timing diagram in Week1 folder of this repo.
